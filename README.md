<br>
The United States has experienced a noteworthy decline in the number of uninsured citizens over the past decade. Specifically, between 2011 and 2021, the proportion of individuals without health insurance plummeted from over 21 percent to approximately 8.9 percent. While certain states have lagged behind in this regard, the overall trend is encouraging.

It is worth noting that there were some fluctuations in this trend over the years. Following a change in administration in 2016 and some associated policy shifts, the number of uninsured Americans did experience a temporary increase. However, subsequent changes in 2020 have led to a renewed downward trajectory. It'll be interesting to see how will unisured numbers look in the upcoming years, but the data suggests that a growing number of individuals have access to health insurance coverage.
